# C-RPG-Project
Its a text based rpg with some story and combat
-made in C with an update loop that display the game map grid and player character which is the 'T' symbol
-explore, fight through enemies, level up, get stronger, get cool powers, and beat the bosses to progress.

Just run the .exe it's not a virus I promise. 
this was a small side project from highschool I did during my C class course.
it was the class I took to learn programming.
